== Overview

_Dock AEM_ is a program for setting up and managing local Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) development environment via Docker. It provides ready-to-go tools for swift bootstrapping and controlling interconnected AEM Author, AEM Publish, AEM Dispatcher, Varnish Cache, Apache Solr, Apache ZooKeeper and SMTP instances. The program supports both on-premise (AEM 6.5) and cloud (AEMaaCS) versions of Adobe Experience Manager.

== Usage
[upperalpha]
. _Dock AEM_ provides a `docker-compose.yml` file and related artifacts, enabling developers to:
[upperroman]
.. build various AEM and AEM-related images
.. run, start, and stop AEM and AEM-related containers

. Supported images include:
[upperroman]
.. AEM Author 6.5
.. AEM Author as a Cloud Service
.. AEM Publish 6.5
.. AEM Publish as a Cloud Service
.. AEM Dispatcher for AMD CPU architecture
.. AEM Dispatcher for ARM CPU architecture
.. Varnish Cache
.. Apache Solr
.. Apache ZooKeeper
.. https://github.com/gessnerfl/fake-smtp-server[Fake SMTP Server]

. Apache Solr and Apache ZooKeeper are configured as a cluster of containers: 3x for Apache Solr and 3x for Apache ZooKeeper. However, all Apache Solr containers are based on the same `solr` image and all Apache ZooKeeper are based on the same `zookeeper` image.

. It is recommended that a machine, either virtual or real, on which _Dock AEM_ images are built and containers are used, has at least 12 GB RAM allocated. Otherwise, the respective Java processes started by the artifacts might be unexpectedly terminated.

=== Images Build

In order to build the _Dock AEM_ images follow the steps below.

[upperalpha]
. Clone the _Dock AEM_ source code repository:
+
[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/ciechanowiec/dock_aem
----

. Remove all preceding _Dock AEM_ containers, images, volumes and networks:
+
[source, bash]
----
artifactsToRemove="aem-base aem-author-65 aem-author-cloud aem-publish-65 aem-publish-cloud dispatcher-amd dispatcher-arm varnish solr1 solr2 solr3 zookeeper1 zookeeper2 zookeeper3 fake-smtp-server"

echo $artifactsToRemove | xargs -n2 docker container stop --time 30

echo $artifactsToRemove | xargs -n2 docker container remove --force

echo $artifactsToRemove | xargs -n2 docker image rm --force

docker volume remove --force aem-author-65-data aem-author-cloud-data aem-publish-65-data aem-publish-cloud-data

docker network rm aem-network
----

. AEM License Key
+
AEM license key should be defined as environmental variable named `LICENSE_KEY`. One of the ways to achieve that is to export the variable in the console session in which the images are built (`<you-license-key>` should be replaced with the actual license key):
+
[source, bash]
----
export LICENSE_KEY=<you-license-key>
----
+
[NOTE]
Among others, your AEM license key can be found in a file named `license.properties` delivered by Adobe and defined in that `license.properties` file as `license.downloadID`.

. `src/quickstart`
+
Put respective AEM QuickStart Jars into `src/quickstart/65` (AEM 6.5) and `src/quickstart/cloud` (AEMaaCS) directories in the _Dock AEM_ source code repository (files inside those directories are git-ignored, so there is no relevant risk of exposing them in the source control). Give both those Jars the following name: `aem-quickstart.jar`.

. `src/packages`
+
If there are any packages that should be preinstalled on AEM Author and AEM Publish, put them respectively into `src/packages/65` (AEM 6.5) or `src/packages/cloud` (AEMaaCS) directories in the _Dock AEM_ source code repository (files inside those directories, just like the files inside `src/quickstart` subdirectories, are git-ignored, so there is no relevant risk of exposing them in the source control).
+
For instance, into `src/packages/65` the following packages can be put:
[upperroman]
.. `aem-service-pkg-6.5.22.0.zip` (AEM Service Pack 6.5.22)
.. `adobe-aemfd-linux-pkg-6.0.1328.zip` (AEM Forms Addon related to AEM 6.5.22)
+
[NOTE]
Regardless of the host operating system on which the images are built (Windows/macOS/Linux), in case of AEM Forms addon a Linux version of the addon should be chosen, since the Dock AEM images are based on Linux.
+
.. `content.zip` (preinstalled content)

+

The `src/packages/cloud` directory, in turn, can be populated with these packages:
[upperroman]
.. `aem-forms-addon-2025.01.22.02-250100.far` (AEM Forms Addon related to AEMaaCS)
.. `content.zip` (preinstalled content)

. `src/commons/crypto`
+
An `src/commons/crypto` directory contains a `data` directory with default `hmac` and `master` keys. Those keys are used by `com.adobe.granite.crypto.file` bundle for secrets encoding and default versions of the keys are provided for deterministic and predictable behavior. If it is necessary to use different keys, replace the existing ones with the new ones. However, note that those keys aren't git-ignored, so be careful and don't git commit sensitive secrets.

. During the images build, AEM Author and AEM Publish instances are started. Among others, this is done in order to initialize persistence layer and reduce the amount of time required for the first clean start of containers based on the built images. The start of AEM Author and AEM Publish is controlled by `src/2_aem/aem-installer.sh` script. That script also shutdowns the instances once the initialization is finished.
+
The initialization is assumed to be finished when all required bundles have started and are active. The amount of required bundles might differ depending on the exact set of preinstalled packages from `src/packages`, on run mode choice (`author`/`publish`, `samplecontent`/`nosamplecontent`) and the subsequent number of an instance start.

[WARNING]
*Due to the bundles readiness check described above, the exact expected amount of active bundles for the specified AEM setups must be configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file.*

. Go to `src` directory in the _Dock AEM_ source code repository. Inside that directory, run the build defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. As a result, ten images will be built: `aem-base`, `aem-author-65`, `aem-author-cloud`, `aem-publish-65`, `aem-publish-cloud`, `dispatcher-amd`, `dispatcher-arm`, `varnish`,  `solr` and `zookeeper`. For fully fledged AEM instances the build might take ~40 minutes in total, depending on hardware capabilities:
+
[source, bash]
----
cd "$pathToDockAEMSourceCodeRepository/src"

docker compose build
----
+
[NOTE]
====
[upperroman]
. In case of certain system setups, the command above should be hyphenated: `docker-compose`.
. Add `--progress=plain` to the above command to see unfolded build output:
+
[source, bash]
----
docker compose --progress=plain build
----
. It is possible to build independently only some specific image defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file by providing that image name to the build command in the following way:
+
[source, bash]
----
docker compose build aem-author-cloud
----
====

. Verify the build and make sure that all _Dock AEM_ images are available on host:
+
[source, bash]
----

=== Container Run, Start & Stop
[upperalpha]
. Containers with AEM Author and AEM Publish instances can be run, started and stopped independently. Containers with other applications for their correct running might, in turn, require some other containers to be active. Such dependencies are either specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file in the `depends_on` directive (e.g. dependency of Apache Solr on Apache ZooKeeper) or is implied by the nature of the application (e.g. dependency of AEM Dispatcher on AEM Publish).
. In order to run a given container _for the first time_, use the `docker-compose.yml` file located inside `src` directory in the _Dock AEM_ source code repository. As a parameter of the command provide the name of the respective service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:
+
[source, bash]
----
docker compose up [service name] --detach
----
+
For instance, the command for running AEM Author as a Cloud Service would look the following way:
+
[source, bash]
----
docker compose up aem-author-cloud --detach
----
+
It is also possible to pass more than one service name as parameters of the run command:
+
[source, bash]
----
docker compose up aem-author-cloud aem-publish-cloud --detach
----
+
In case of containers with dependencies it is sufficient just to run the container that has dependencies, because the dependency-containers will be activated automatically. For example, Apache Solr instances depend on Apache ZooKeeper instances. Therefore, running Apache Solr instances will automatically activate all related Apache ZooKeeper containers:
+
[source, bash]
----
docker compose up solr1 solr2 solr3 --detach
----
+
[NOTE]
In case of certain system setups, the commands above should be hyphenated: `docker-compose`.

. All AEM images have a license key embedded during the build. That license key can be overridden by providing a `LICENSE_KEY` environmental variable when a given AEM container is run _for the first time_.

. After the first run a given container can be started and stopped via regular Docker commands by providing respective container names, like in these examples:
+
[source, bash]
----
# AEM Author as a Cloud Service:
docker start aem-author-cloud
docker stop aem-author-cloud

# AEM Publish as a Cloud Service:
docker start aem-publish-cloud
docker stop aem-publish-cloud

# Apache Solr:
docker start solr1 solr2 solr3
docker stop solr1 solr2 solr3
----

=== AEM Dispatcher & Varnish Cache Specifics
[upperalpha]
. AEM Dispatcher and Varnish Cache containers might not run and start if no AEM Publish instance is active. The reason for such behavior is that AEM Dispatcher and Varnish Cache reference an AEM Publish domain name, hence when AEM Publish instance isn't available, the reference is void, which is not supported by AEM Dispatcher or Varnish Cache.
. AEM Dispatcher and Varnish Cache configuration files used during images build are the default ones, but adjusted as little as possible according to the official instructions. The original versions of the configuration files for the sake of comparison are kept in respective directories besides the changed ones.
. In order to transfer files (primarily new configuration files) from the host into a container in which AEM Dispatcher or Varnish Cache are run, use commands constructed in the following way:
+
[source, bash]
----
# AEM Dispatcher - AMD:
docker cp "$HOME/dispatcher.any" dispatcher-amd:/etc/apache2/conf/dispatcher.any

# AEM Dispatcher - ARM:
docker cp "$HOME/dispatcher.any" dispatcher-arm:/etc/apache2/conf/dispatcher.any

# Varnish Cache:
docker cp "$HOME/default.vcl" varnish:/etc/varnish/default.vcl
----

. In order to activate new configuration of AEM Dispatcher or Varnish Cache, there is no need to restart containers. New configuration can be applied via reloading:
+
[source, bash]
----
# AEM Dispatcher - AMD:
docker exec dispatcher-amd /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

# AEM Dispatcher - ARM:
docker exec dispatcher-arm /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

# Varnish Cache:
docker exec varnish varnishreload
----

=== Solr Configuration Sets Updates
Apache Solr image embeds an `update-configset.sh` script that can be used to update configuration sets of the instance. Usage manual is provided in the script itself. There is also a `download-configsets.sh` script embedded for exporting existing configuration sets.

=== Mobile Volumes
[upperalpha]
. Persistence layers of AEM Author and AEM Publish instances are linked to `/opt/aem/author/crx-quickstart` and `/opt/aem/publish/crx-quickstart` paths inside respective containers. Those paths are mount points for `aem-author-data-65`, `aem-author-data-cloud`, `aem-publish-data-65` and `aem-publish-data-cloud` volumes respectively, physically stored on a host at `/var/lib/docker/volumes` and managed by Docker. It means that persistence layers of AEM Author and AEM Publish instances are separated from the application.

. If `aem-author-data-65`, `aem-author-data-cloud`, `aem-publish-data-65` or `aem-publish-data-cloud` volume doesn't exist when a container with AEM Author or AEM Publish respectively is run for the first time, then a respective volume will be created and mounted to the container. However, if a respective volume does already exist, then no new volume will be created and the existing one will be reused, so that even to a new container the old volume with old persistence layer will be mounted. In order to avoid such reuse, before a new container is run for the first time, the respective volume should be priorly removed:
+
[source, bash]
----
# AEM Author 6.5:
docker volume remove --force aem-author-data-65

# AEM Author as a Cloud Service:
docker volume remove --force aem-author-data-cloud

# AEM Publish 6.5:
docker volume remove --force aem-publish-data-65

# AEM Publish as a Cloud Service:
docker volume remove --force aem-publish-data-cloud
----

. The described volumes mechanism makes AEM Author and AEM Publish persistence layers mobile, transferable and backupable. That mechanism can be rolled out to remote environments in order to make those environments fully reproducible locally.

== Start Command Decomposition
This section explains every part of commands used to start AEM instances. The explanation employs an example based on the command for the AEM Author, but nevertheless for AEM Publish the command is analogous.

[upperalpha]
. Set max heap size:
+
`-Xmx4096M`
+
_Docs:_ +
https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/deploying/deploying/deploy.html?lang=en (`-Xmx1024M` is given as recommended, but it is too little for parallel garbage collection)

. Fix Java 11 bug related to ZIP validation:
+
`-Djdk.util.zip.disableZip64ExtraFieldValidation=true`
+

.. https://liferay.atlassian.net/browse/LPS-191551

. Run AEM in a headless mode because it is run inside a Docker container:
+
`-Djava.awt.headless=true`

. Set JVM specific parameters for Java 11:
+
`-XX:+UseParallelGC --add-opens=java.desktop/com.sun.imageio.plugins.jpeg=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/sun.net.www.protocol.jrt=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.naming/javax.naming.spi=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.dom=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/jdk.internal.loader=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.net=ALL-UNNAMED -Dnashorn.args=--no-deprecation-warning`
+
_Docs:_ +
https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/deploying/deploying/custom-standalone-install.html?lang=en

. Run AEM in debug mode on the given port, additionally to the basic port:

`-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:8888`
+
_Docs:_ +
https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/debugging/debugging-aem-sdk/remote-debugging.html?lang=en

. Set initial admin password in non-interactive mode. The admin password from
a `passwordfile.properties` file is assessed only during the first AEM start. If after the first AEM start the admin password is changed, the new password is effective regardless of the content of a `passwordfile.properties` file:
+
`-Dadmin.password.file=/opt/aem/author/passwordfile.properties` +
(...) +
`-nointeractive`
+
_Docs:_ +
https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/security/security-configure-admin-password.html?lang=en

. Set run modes. The hyphenated `author-local` run mode is required for cases where dot-driven run mode like `author.local` isn't supported:
+
`-Dsling.run.modes=author,nosamplecontent,local,author-local`
+
_Docs:_ +
https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/deploying/configuring/configure-runmodes.html?lang=en

. Set port:
+
`-port 4502`
+
_Docs:_ +
https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/deploying/deploying/custom-standalone-install.html?lang=en

. Exclude forks (among others, it mitigates warnings in the console):
+
`-nofork`
+
_Docs:_ +
https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/deploying/deploying/custom-standalone-install.html?lang=en

. Don't open AEM in a browser, since AEM is run inside a Docker container:
+
`-nobrowser`
+
